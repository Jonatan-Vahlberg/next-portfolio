I worked with a company called [MyIndicators](http://myindicators.net/) on developing an collabrative self-care and behavioral change application in React-Native for IOS and Android. I started my work at MyIndicators in 2019 with a school internship and over the course of 2020 i worked parttime with finishing proposed features for the application.

When i started at MyIndicators i was both a intern and the lead developer. My job was porting and recreating an IOS only application that was built by a seconed team prior. This included designing, coding, minor testing and taking part in taking part in a SCRUM like team and sprint by sprint making a finished product. I learnt alot of technical skills, and general best practices during my time a MyIndicators and i feel it was one of my more rewarding courses/experiances during my schooling.

For more information on the project and my role you can visit the [website](http://myli.se) or contact my former employer,
