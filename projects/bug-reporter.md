A React-Native bug reporting tool built as my final examination project in 2020 for a [Mobile Application HVE/YH course.](https://www.sti.se/yh-utbildningar/mobilapputvecklare/)

The Application is built for android and was built with a few features in mind.

- Bug reporting
- Commenting Report
- Team Structure
- Moderation and admin tools for teams
- Original UI
- Push Notifications
- Authentication
